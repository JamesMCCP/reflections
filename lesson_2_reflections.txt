What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden ".git" repository. You need to intiate a repository to enable the git functionality.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is the temporary space where commit files are stored before being commited. It also allows one to commit only the files you want saved.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the git diff --staged command to see the differences between the master file and the most recent commit to ensure that you are actually making one logical change per commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

I think branches would help a lot if you are experimenting with different forms of prototypes or looking to make changes that are relatively unrelated to the master document.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It allows you to quickly recognise branches, especially those that are unreachable.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It adds lines of code that were deliberately added, and those that were deliberately added, and combines them into a single branch. The diagram makes it very easy to see how the merged branches related to each other.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

The pro's are that you individually assess each branch, and ensure that merging two branches effectively resolves the conflict. The con is that this process doesn't happen automatically - and that you might even miss some conflicts that could bite you in the ass later.
