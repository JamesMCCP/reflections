What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden ".git" repository. You need to intiate a repository to enable the git functionality.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is the temporary space where commit files are stored before being commited. It also allows one to commit only the files you want saved.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the git diff --staged command to see the differences between the master file and the most recent commit to ensure that you are actually making one logical change per commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

I think branches would help a lot if you are experimenting with different forms of prototypes or looking to make changes that are relatively unrelated to the master document.
